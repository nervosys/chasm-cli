# Commercial License

## Chasm — Dual Licensing

Chasm is available under two licenses:

### 1. Open Source — AGPL v3

The default license is the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0** ([LICENSE](LICENSE)).

Under the AGPL v3, you may freely use, modify, and distribute Chasm, provided that:

- Any modified version you deploy over a network **must make its complete source code available** to users of that service.
- All derivative works must also be licensed under AGPL v3.
- You must preserve all copyright and license notices.

This ensures that improvements to Chasm remain available to the community.

### 2. Commercial License

If the AGPL v3 does not meet your needs — for example, if you:

- Want to integrate Chasm into **proprietary software** without open-sourcing your code
- Want to offer Chasm as part of a **commercial SaaS product**
- Need to distribute Chasm to customers **without AGPL obligations**
- Require **custom terms**, SLAs, or indemnification

...you can purchase a **commercial license** from Nervosys LLC.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use Chasm for free in my company?**
Yes — as long as you comply with the AGPL v3. If you modify Chasm and deploy it on a network, you must make the complete modified source code available to users.

**Q: Can I use Chasm in internal tools without a commercial license?**
Yes — internal use that does not involve conveying the software to others is permitted under AGPL v3. However, if internal users interact with a modified version over a network, the source must be available (Section 13 of AGPL v3).

**Q: Do I need a commercial license to use the CLI locally?**
No. Local use of the unmodified CLI is fully permitted under AGPL v3.

**Q: What if I embed Chasm's library in my proprietary application?**
You need a commercial license. Linking against an AGPL-licensed library makes your application a derivative work that must also be AGPL-licensed — unless you have a commercial license.

**Q: Can I contribute to Chasm under AGPL v3?**
Yes. Contributors must sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](CONTRIBUTING.md) that grants Nervosys LLC the right to offer contributions under both licenses. This is standard practice for dual-licensed projects.
