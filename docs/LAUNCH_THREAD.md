### 🧵 1/12 — Hook

Your AI chat history is a ticking time bomb.

VS Code update? Gone.
Renamed a folder? Gone.
Cursor crash? Gone.

We analyzed 100+ forum threads. Session loss is the #1 pain point across every AI coding assistant.

So we built Chasm. 🔗

### 2/12 — What is Chasm

Chasm is an open-source CLI that harvests, recovers, and unifies your AI chat sessions across every provider.

Copilot · Cursor · Windsurf · Claude · ChatGPT · Ollama · 20+ more.

One command. All your history. Never lost again.

`cargo install chasm-cli`

### 3/12 — Recovery (38% demand)

The #1 use case: recover lost sessions.

```
chasm fetch path /path/to/project
```

That's it. Sessions reappear in VS Code's Chat dropdown.

Renamed your project folder? Chasm finds orphaned sessions too:

```
chasm detect orphaned --recover /path/to/project
```

50+ Cursor forum threads asked for exactly this. Zero tools solved it—until now.

---

### 4/12 — Harvest & Export (27% demand)

Every AI tool stores history differently. Copilot uses SQLite + JSONL. Cursor uses a proprietary format. Claude is web-only.

Chasm harvests them all into one searchable database:

```
chasm harvest scan
chasm harvest run
chasm harvest search "auth implementation"
```

Export to JSON, Markdown, CSV, or JSONL. Your conversations, your data.

---

### 5/12 — Run & Record

Chat with any AI provider from your terminal. Every message is auto-saved. No more lost sessions from editor crashes.

```
chasm run ollama -m codellama
chasm run claude
chasm run chatgpt -m gpt-4o
chasm run claudecode --workspace ./project
```

Real-time recording via REST + WebSocket ensures nothing is lost—even mid-stream.

---

### 6/12 — No vendor lock-in

Switch from Copilot to Cursor? Cursor to Claude? Local Ollama to cloud GPT-4o?

Your entire conversation history comes with you.

Chasm normalizes every provider into a universal session format. Import, export, search, and continue—regardless of source.

No more starting from zero when you switch tools.

---

### 7/12 — Agentic coding

Like Claude Code, but provider-agnostic.

```
chasm agency run "Add error handling to main.rs"
chasm agency run -m ollama/codellama "Write tests for lib.rs"
chasm agency run --orchestration swarm "Build a REST API"
```

Single agent. Multi-agent swarm. Parallel execution. Hierarchical delegation. Debate mode.

Use any model. Keep all history.

---

### 8/12 — Merge & consolidate

Long-running projects scatter sessions across workspaces, branches, and providers.

```
chasm merge path /path/to/project
chasm merge all
```

Consolidate dozens of fragmented sessions into a coherent timeline. Essential for team handoffs and context loading.

---
